  - title: Fast.
    text: My websites are built with Next JS which is a static site generator and
      more. It enables me to build some of the fastest websites available much faster
      than wordpress sites.
  - title: Secure.
    text: 'Next JS also provides me with lots more benefits, one being security. Due
      to the way it is built, my websites are as secure as you can make them with
      almost no security issues or worries. '
  - title: Versatile.
    text: My websites can also be used as mobile apps (or Progressive Web Apps (PWA)).
      This means they can be installed onto practically any device and be used offline.
  - title: Inexpensive.
    text: Like many things websites are getting more and more expensive. On the contrary
      to this trend, my websites cost from only £10 per year (or £0.80 per month)
      while being faster, more secure and more versatile than any other type of website.

  questions:
  - question: How much do websites cost?
    answer: Our websites cost £150 upfront to buy the website and set it up for you.
      Then it is £10 per year which include website and image hosting, domain name,
      etc. We set you up to pay for this directly.
  - question: Do we have to stay with you?
    answer: No. We set you up with our websites so you could get another developer
      to do any maintenance or changes. However, make sure they know the technologies
      that the website is built in.
  - question: What if I don't want an admin system?
    answer: If you do not want the admin system, then we will not set you up with
      one. Although, we do recommend having one as it is included in the £10 per year
      running cost and means that you can edit the website easily yourself and do
      not need to pay the developer to do it.
  - answer: 'Yes we can. However, that does come at a cost, £20 per month to be precise. '
    question: Can you maintain and manage it?
