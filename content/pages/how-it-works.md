      text: Don't spend hours going through each individual letter and name trying
        to find phone numbers from the BT Phonebook. We do all the hard work for you
        letting you get on with what's more important.
    - title: Easy.
      text: Our system only requires 1 field to get started with. Making it much easier
        and nicer to use.
    - title: Secure.
      text: Unlike other phone number directories that may record your directory search
        history. We <strong>do not</strong> record any data of any kind. Meaning you

    process:
    - text: 'Navigate to the <a href="/" title="Home Page">homepage</a> and find the
        Search form. It has 2 fields:  a "town or postcode" field and a "street" field
        as well as a search button. Only the "town or postcode" field is required.'
      title: Navigate to our website.
    - title: Enter your information.
      text: Enter the relevant details. The town and postcode field is required but
        we recommend using the street field for more accurate results. Once, all the
        information is filled in, press on the "Search" button and we will start to
        find phone numbers for us.
    - title: Get results.
      text: 'If there are results, they will appear in a table below the search form.
        It will have the name, address, telephone number and a button that copies
        the phone number when you click it. '
    - title: Repeat.
      text: 'Now, you can repeat steps 2 and 3 to find more phone numbers. '
